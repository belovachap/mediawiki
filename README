= mediawiki - Accessing MediaWiki from Haskell =

'mediawiki' is a Haskell package providing a comprehensive binding to
the programmatic interface to MediaWiki (aka, 'the MediaWiki API') -

  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API

The binding is allegedly complete (2008-11-17), letting you write
applications in Haskell that accesses and (if enabled by target Wiki)
manipulate content on MediaWiki pages.

= Getting started =

For some code samples showing you how to get started using this
API binding, have a look in the examples/ directory. 

= Building and installing =

This package is provided in Cabal form, so only thing you need to
do to get going is:

  foo% runghc Setup configure
  foo% runghc Setup build 
  foo% runghc Setup install

The package depends on a bunch of other packages though, so you
need to have them built&installed, as well. They are:

  * HTTP: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HTTP
  * xml: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xml
  * mime: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/mime
  * utf8-string: http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/utf8-string
